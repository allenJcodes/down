# Mental & Process Learnings

Track insights about problem-solving, workflow, and development process throughout the DOWN platformer project.

---

## Problem Solving

### Learnings
- Breaking down complex mechanics into tutorial rooms helps validate each system independently
- Physics issues often require experimentation with velocity caps and collision settings
- Visual debugging (console logs, color flashes) speeds up troubleshooting

---

## Project Management

### Learnings
- Building tutorial rooms first helps validate mechanics before creating complex levels
- Modular entity classes make adding new enemies and obstacles straightforward
- Separating systems (HealthSystem utility) promotes reusability across scenes

---

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Learnings
- Invulnerability frames solve multiple-damage-trigger issues elegantly
- Phaser's arcade physics has limitations with very high velocities
- Need to manage collision state carefully with overlap detection

---

## Learning Process

### Learnings
- Placeholder graphics allow rapid prototyping without waiting for assets
- Testing each tutorial room individually catches issues early
- Scene transitions need explicit testing to ensure smooth flow
