## What Worked Well

### Successes
- Modular scene structure makes it easy to add new tutorial rooms and levels
- Health system as a utility class is reusable across all scenes
- Tutorial progression effectively teaches mechanics without overwhelming players
- Phaser's arcade physics provides good-enough collision for platformer gameplay
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors early in development

---

## What Could Be Improved

### Areas for Enhancement
- Need proper sprite assets to replace placeholder rectangles
- Sound effects would significantly improve game feel
- Score calculation system needs implementation
- Leaderboard integration is ready but not connected to gameplay
- More visual polish (particles, screen shake) would enhance impact

---

## Unexpected Challenges

### Surprises
- Fast fall mechanic required velocity capping to prevent physics glitches
- Invulnerability frames were necessary to prevent frustrating rapid damage
- Timer display needed special handling to stay fixed during camera scroll
- Scene transitions work better with explicit zones than automatic triggers

---

## Surprising Discoveries

### Pleasant Surprises
- Phaser integrates smoothly with Next.js despite being a canvas-based library
- Tutorial rooms are fun to play even with placeholder graphics
- Modular entity design makes adding new enemies trivial
- TypeScript's strict mode actually speeds up development by catching issues early
