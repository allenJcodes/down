## Phaser Game Engine

### Learnings
- Phaser's arcade physics requires velocity caps for fast-moving objects to prevent clipping through platforms
- Graphics objects are useful for placeholder visuals during prototyping
- Scene data passing is cleaner than global state for simple games
- Camera follow needs smooth interpolation (0.1, 0.1) for good feel
- `setScrollFactor(0)` keeps UI elements fixed when camera scrolls
